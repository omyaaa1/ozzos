# Ozzos Local Gallery

This is a personal local gallery, built with nothing but the ozz aesthetic toolkit you provided. Each card, hover, and modal interaction was handcrafted locally—no external CMS, no heavy frameworks, just the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this folder.

It feels like a small, focused deck of inspiration: static files that pull from CDN-hosted fonts, lightweight Masonry + imagesLoaded helpers, and a pure JavaScript flow for uploads, infinite scroll, and the immersive modal. Even the uploads stay local via localStorage, so the gallery remains personal, fast, and entirely in your control.

Drop this folder onto any static host (the Vercel deployment already points to it), and you’ll get the same tactile browse/zoom experience you see on the live site.
